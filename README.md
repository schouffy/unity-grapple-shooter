# unity-grapple-shooter

# Introduction

You can play the game online here : https://schouffy.itch.io/the-gatherer

It's a FPS game with a blaster and a grappling hook made in Unity. My focus was to have good controls, and feeling of freedom and sense of height.


# Context

This game was created in 1 month (maybe a bit more ^_^), as part of a "3 games in 3 months" challenge i've set myself up with. The objective is to make games of small scope, but with a good level of polish, that i can use as showcase demos to look for a job in the game industry.

As part of the challenge, i am forced to make all the assets myself to learn about the workflow of 2d artists, 3d modelers, animators,...

I cover some of the technical aspects or decisions i made (as a solo non-artist programmer) in my Tumblr (https://thegamedevquest.tumblr.com/)


# Assets

All the code is written by me (except the occasional copy/paste from StackOverflow or answers.unity3d), except for the following :
- My grapple is a modified version of https://gitlab.com/affax/unity-grappling-hook. I've struggled a lot with physics and joints before finally going with manually applying forces.
- EZ Camera shake (https://github.com/andersonaddo/EZ-Camera-Shake-Unity)
- Object pool (from a Brackeys video)

All the art is done by me, in Blender and Substance Painter, except for the following :
- Concrete texture is from https://cc0textures.com/view?id=Concrete008
- Explosions are from Unity particle pack https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/tutorial-projects/unity-particle-pack-127325


Sounds are from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/sound-fx/universal-sound-fx-17256

Musics are from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/audio/music/orchestral/ultimate-game-music-collection-37351


# License

Do whatever you want with the code or assets EXCEPT the sounds and musics, that are part of a Unity Asset Store package i purchased a while back. You can't use those without asking their author.
